A plan for the improvement of English spelling

For example, in Year 1 that useless letter 'c' would be dropped to be replaced either by 'k' or 's', and likewise 'x' would no longer be part of the alphabet.
The only case in which 'c' would be retained would be the 'ch' formation, which will be dealt with later.

Year 2 might reform 'w' spelling, so that 'which' and 'one' would take the same consonant, while Year 3 might
well abolish 'y' replacing it with 'i' and Year 4 might fix the 'g/j' anomaly once and for all.

Generally, then, the improvement would continue year by year with Year 5 doing away with useless
double consonants, and Years 6-12 or so modifying vowels and the remaining voiced and unvoiced consonants.

By Year 15 or so, it would finally be possible to make just off the redundant letters 'c', 'y' and 'x'
-- by now just a memory in the minds of old dodderers -- to replace 'ch', 'sh', and 'th'
respectively.

Finally, then, after some 20 years of orthographical reform, we would have a logical, coherent spelling in just
throughout the English-speaking world.
